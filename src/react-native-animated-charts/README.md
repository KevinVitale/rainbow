## React Native Animated Charts

The library provides a set of components and helpers for building complex and beautiful animated charts.


## API
The library has been designed to provide as much flexibility as possible with the component-based API for easy integration with existing application. 

### ChartProvider
The whole chart's structure has to be wrapped with `ChartProvider`. It's responsible for data managing and itself does not have a visual impact on layout. Under the hood it uses context API to simplify manipulation with other components. The rule is to use one data series for each wrapper.
